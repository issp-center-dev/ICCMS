# ICCMS 2019


In recent years, many researchers are applying "data science" to tackle difficult problems in materials science in addition to the more conventional theoretical, experimental, and computational approaches.ã€€In this camp, we invite lecturers who are active in the forefront of the field of data science. Participants will learn how to apply data science approaches to numerical simulations and to perform advanced data analysis based on the combination of computational and data science methods. This will be achieved through group exercises with the ultimate goal of utilizing these methods in participants' own research projects. In addition, we will aim to cultivate an innovation mindset from discussions with lecturers who are active across various fields in industry, government, and academia.
